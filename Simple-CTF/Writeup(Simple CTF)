Let's start by scanning the machine using nmap.
sudo nmap -sSCV -vv {MACHINE IP}
 [1](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/1.png)
As shown in the output we can login ftp by using ftp as username.
After loging into ftp we found a directory named pub and in that directory we found a .txt file (ForMitch.txt). Let's get that file on our attacker machine.

It's a note for user Mitch
 [3](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/3.png)
As we know port 80 is open and running http service, so let's open the webpage. It's a default apache webpage.
 [4](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/4.png)
Let's run gobuster to find any hidden directory.
gobuster dir -u http://{MACHINEIP} -w /PATH TO WORDLIST
 [5](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/5.png)
We found a hidden directory. Let's go to that directory and it's a CMS page. After scrolling down to the page we found the version of the CMS.
 [6](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/6.png)
Now we can check for a CVE for CMS Made Simple Version 2.2.8 and we found a CVE on Exploit Database.
 [7](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/7.png)
Q) What's the CVE you're using against the application?
A) CVE-2***-***3
Q) To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?
A) s***
Now we have a CVE so we can use it to get password. Let's download the CVE and crack the password.
python 46635.py -u http://{MACHINE IP}/simple --crack -w /PATH TO WORDLIST
 [8](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/8.png)
We can also use hydra to get password by using the userame Mitch we found in the ftp.
hydra -l mitch -P /PATH TO WORDLIST ssh://MACHINE IP:2222
 [9](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/9.png)
Q) What's the password?
A )s****t
Q) Where can you login with the details obtained?
A) s**
Now we got the password let's login into ssh using the credentials.
ssh mitch@MACHINE IP -p 2222
Let's first spawn a stable shell using python
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
 [10](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/10.png)
After listing all the files in user directory we found the user flag.
 [11](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/11.png)
Q) What's the user flag?
A) G*** ***, **** **!
We also found an another user in the home directory. 
 [12](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/12.png)
Q) Is there any other user in the home directory? What's its name?
A) S*****h
Let's check for sudo privileges of the user Mitch.
sudo -l
Mitch have sudo privileges for vim. 
We can use vim for privilege escalation
sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'
 [13](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/13.png)
Q) What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?
A) v**
We are root now
Let's cd to root and get the root flag
 [14](https://github.com/M4ddy19/TRYHACKME/blob/main/Simple-CTF/Images/14.png)
Q) What's the root flag?
A) W*** ****. *** **** **!
